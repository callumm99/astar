# astar
My earliest successful attempt to implement the common pathfinding algorithms in C++ (September 2015). I was aged 16.

This was the predecessor to the later, more refined (and allegedly improved) 'pathfinder' program I produced at the end of 2016 (see https://github.com/callumm99/pathfinder).

Compiled with Visual Studio C++ 2010 (younger me hadn't yet discovered C++11 nor 14). Younger me has an embarrassingly ugly coding style. This is quite the time capsule.
